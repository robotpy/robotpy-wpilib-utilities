    """
    This object is designed to be used to implement autonomous modes that
    can be used with the :class:`.AutonomousModeSelector` object to select
    an appropriate autonomous mode. However, you don't have to.

    This object is designed to meet the following goals:

    - Supports simple built-in tuning of autonomous mode parameters via
      SmartDashboard
    - Easy to create autonomous modes that support state machine or
      time-based operation
    - Autonomous modes that are easy to read and understand

    You use this by defining a class that inherits from ``StatefulAutonomous``.
    To define each state, you use the :func:`timed_state` decorator on a
    function. When each state is run, the decorated function will be
    called. Decorated functions can receive the following parameters:

    - ``tm`` - The number of seconds since autonomous has started
    - ``state_tm`` - The number of seconds since this state has been active
      (note: it may not start at zero!)
    - ``initial_call`` - Set to True when the state is initially called,
      False otherwise. If the state is switched to multiple times, this
      will be set to True at the start of each state.

    An example autonomous mode that drives the robot forward for 5 seconds
    might look something like this::

        from robotpy_ext.autonomous import StatefulAutonomous

        class DriveForward(StatefulAutonomous):

            MODE_NAME = 'Drive Forward'

            def initialize(self):
                pass

            @timed_state(duration=0.5, next_state='drive_forward', first=True)
            def drive_wait(self):
                pass

            @timed_state(duration=5)
            def drive_forward(self):
                self.drive.move(0, 1, 0)

    Note that in this example, it is assumed that the DriveForward object
    is initialized with a dictionary with a value 'drive' that contains
    an object that has a move function::

        components = {'drive': SomeObject() }
        mode = DriveForward(components)

    If you use this object with :class:`.AutonomousModeSelector`, make sure
    to initialize it with the dictionary, and it will be passed to this
    autonomous mode object when initialized.

                 some basic usage of ``AutonomousModeSelector``.
